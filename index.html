							I am a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) majoring in Computer Science
							with a minor in Data Science. In my time at WPI, I completed my Interactive Qualifying
							Project (IQP) in Bejing, China in the Summer of 2019, and a Summer internship at Juniper
							Networks in 2020. These were great experiences that I got the opportunity to do, and now I 
							am currently finishing up my Major Qualifying Project (MQP) at WPI to fullfill my last graduation requriement. 
							Feel free to check the 'Projects' section of this site for more details about them!

							emoji, and I tend to use it a lot mainly because I just like the design.

					<h4>Biomedical Data Pipeline</h4>
					<p>
						This is my Major Qualifying Project (MQP) for WPI where I am working in a team of 6 to design 
						a data pipeline web application using Django. The goal of this project was to create a platform
						to manage and analyze biomedical data for researchers. There are 3 main features of this data pipeline;
						uploading data, single/cross study selection, and data analysis. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies/Practices Used:</strong>
						Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, Heroku, Agile Methodology, Scrum
					</p>

					<h4>Benchmarking Open Source Cloud Databases</h4>
					<p>
						This was my internship project at Juniper Networks. The goal of this project was to select a Cloud Database 
						to use in the Control/User Plan Separation project. With the embedded control plane being moved into a Cloud
						Native Environment, it was necessary for the shared-memory database to be backed by a persistent database in 
						order to ensure recovery of the data. The persistent database selection is critical because the performance of 
						it could impact one of Juniper's services, so the goal was to find a database that would have a minimum impact. 
						My benchmark application was designed to help the Broadband Edge team choose an effective database to use as the 
						persistent database.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
						C++, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL

					<h4>COLA Search Application</h4>
					<p>
						This was my term project for my Software Engineering course where I had to work in a team of 10 to redesign 
						the COLA Search application, an existing web application that provides users alcohol labeling information. 
						The goal of this project was to improve the overall user interface and functionality of the "out of date" 
						application. Working on this project was my first introduction of going through the software development process.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies/Practices Used:</strong>
						Java, JavaFX, MongoDB, Agile Methodology, Scrum

					<h4>Bose AR Instrument</h4>
					<p>
						This was my Hackathon project that I worked on in a team of 5. This project was an Android application that 
						generates drum sounds through the Bose Frame glasses upon detection of a user head movement. The idea was to 
						play a specific drum sound depending on the direction at which the user's head moved in. In order to have the 
						Android app be able to communicate with the Bose Frame glasses, the Bose AR SDK was utilized. This project ended 
						up winning the Bose Award for Best Project that Utilized the Bose AR SDK.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies:</strong>
						Android, Bose AR SDK

					<h4>Chat Room</h4>
					<p>
						This was a small personal project that I did to help get me familiar with socket programming. This project essentially
						replicates the main functionality of a chat room application where multiple of users could enter a room and chat with 
						each other. I implemented the application to allow communication between all connected clients through a TCP connection.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies:</strong>
						C++

					<h4>SASE NERC 2020 Website</h4>
					<p>
						WPI was selected to host the 2020 SASE NERC conference and I volunteered to be a part of the committee in charge 
						of setting up the event. My role within the committee was the web-master, and I was in charge of designing the website 
						for the conference. This was a project that I did to help me start learning HTML/CSS, and Javascript. In this project 
						I was not only introduced to designing a website, but also the process of setting up the domain to host the website. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Technologies:</strong>
						HTML/CSS, Javascript (Node.js)
